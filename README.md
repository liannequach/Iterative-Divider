# Iterative-Divider
We are using a Finite State to model sequential logic that transits among a finite number of 
internal states. FSM designs with the least possible amount of states to perform the function. The 
transitions through states occur as functions of the present state of the machine and the current 
inputs, and the outputs at any state are functions of the present state or functions of the present 
state and present inputs.
